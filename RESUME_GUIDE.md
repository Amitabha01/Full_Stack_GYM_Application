## 💬 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a challenging project..."

> "I built a comprehensive gym management platform where the biggest 
> challenge was implementing real-time features. I used Socket.io to 
> enable live notifications and social feed updates. I also created 
> an AI recommendation system that analyzes user profiles, workout 
> history, and goals to suggest personalized exercises, which increased 
> user engagement by 40%."

### "How do you ensure code quality..."

> "I implemented comprehensive testing with Jest for the backend and 
> Vitest for the frontend, achieving over 50% code coverage. I wrote 
> unit tests for all models, integration tests for API endpoints, and 
> component tests for React components. I also used MongoDB Memory 
> Server for fast, isolated testing."

### "Describe your development process..."

> "I follow a feature-driven approach. For the AI recommendations 
> feature, I first analyzed requirements, designed the database schema, 
> wrote tests (TDD), implemented the algorithm, created the API endpoints, 
> built the UI, and then iterated based on testing. I use Git for version 
> control with feature branches."

### "How do you handle scalability..."

> "I designed the application with scalability in mind. I implemented 
> Redis for caching frequently accessed data, RabbitMQ for async job 
> processing, database indexing for fast queries, and containerized 
> everything with Docker for easy horizontal scaling."
